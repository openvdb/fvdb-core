/// a frozen Peng sign and a Russo-Smereka subcell fix that anchors the zero crossing), then
/// optionally de-staircases it with mean-curvature or volume-preserving Taubin Laplacian smoothing.
/// The grid topology is unchanged: the returned JaggedTensor has the same per-voxel ordering as the
/// input.
///
/// @param batchHdl    Grid batch defining the sparse topology.
/// @param field       Per-voxel signed field with finite values and shape (N,) or (N, 1),
///                    N == totalVoxels. It must represent the intended inside/outside regions and
///                    zero crossings. Magnitudes need not be accurate distances, but affect
///                    convergence, accuracy, and sub-voxel surface location. Invalid shapes and
///                    NaN/Inf values raise ValueError. Leave no-data voxels inactive. A voxel whose
///                    value is exactly 0 has a zero frozen sign and is left at 0 by the redistance
///                    (no-data pass-through), though its signed neighbours see it as an interface.
///                    The surface is where the field changes sign between ACTIVE voxels; a grid
///                    whose active values are all one sign has no surface and comes back as the
///                    constant -/+band*vx. Voxels must be isotropic (a ValueError is raised
///                    otherwise).
/// @param band        Narrow-band half-width in voxels. The field is clamped to [-band*vx, band*vx]
///                    each sweep. Inactive neighbours act as a Dirichlet boundary whose value
///                    uses the adjacent voxel's frozen sign during redistancing and its current
///                    sign during smoothing: -band*vx for negative, +band*vx otherwise. An
///                    IndexGrid has a single background slot, so this is how a narrow band with an
///                    inactive interior (e.g. the output of rebuild_narrow_band) is kept solid
///                    rather than hollow.
/// @param redistanceIters  Number of TVD-RK redistancing sweeps. Pass <= 0 to use the default
///                         max(20, 6*band). The same count is used for the redistance that follows
///                         smoothing, so a small explicit value renormalizes the smoothed field
///                         only within about 0.4*redistanceIters voxels of the surface.
/// @param order       TVD-RK order: 1 (forward Euler), 2 (Heun), or 3 (Shu-Osher). The redistance
///                    marches to a steady state, so the order does not change the converged result;
///                    1 is the cheapest in time and scratch memory.
/// @param smooth      Number of smoothing passes (0 disables smoothing). After smoothing the field
///                    is redistanced again, anchored to the smoothed zero crossing.
/// @param smoothing   Which Laplacian flow each smoothing pass applies (mean-curvature or Taubin).
/// @return A new per-voxel SDF JaggedTensor on the same grid/ordering as @p field.
